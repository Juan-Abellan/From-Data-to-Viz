# From-Data-to-Viz 

## Background & Objectives

The purpose of this reboot is to choose the right data visualization for a given question on a dataset. Freely inspired from https://www.data-to-viz.com/.

## Data

Let's explore the Seaborn [**Iris**](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/iris.csv) dataset, quite known in the Machine Learning beginners community.
Here's a nice picture to get used to the vocabulary around those flowers:

## Tools
For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and Seaborn.
